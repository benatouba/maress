Application for Ecological Data Integration and AI-Assisted Information Management

The application is developed in the course of an incubator program by NFDI4Earth by scientists from Technische
Universit√§t Berlin.

## Currently we are planning to implement the following features:
- **Research Data Mapping**: Visualize and manage research data in a graph-based interface with connections of research papers, datasets, and other resources.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Create and manage geospatial features of your research data in a map-based interface.
- **AI-Assisted Information Management**: Use AI to assist in the management and analysis of research data, including automated tagging, summarization, and recommendation of related resources.
- **Semantic Mapping**: Information retrieval and semantic search capabilities based on text processing and metadata extraction.
